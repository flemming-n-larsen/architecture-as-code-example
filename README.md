## 🎯 What This Repository Demonstrates

This is a complete working example of **executable architecture**—documentation that lives with your code, guides
implementation, and stays synchronized as your system evolves.

### The Three Pillars

```
architecture/
├── adr/                    # WHY: Architecture Decision Records
│   └── 0001-use-uuid-primary-keys.md
├── c4-views/               # WHAT: System structure at multiple zoom levels
│   └── system-context.md
└── models/                 # HOW: Domain entities and business flows
    ├── domain/order.md
    └── flows/create-order.md
```

**Three pillars:** ADRs document *why* decisions were made, C4 diagrams show *what* the system looks like at different
levels, and domain models explain *how* entities relate and workflows execute.

### 🔗 Quick Links

| Category | Link | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| **ADRs** | [architecture/adr/](./architecture/adr/) | Architecture Decision Records |
| **C4 Views** | [architecture/c4-views/](./architecture/c4-views/) | System diagrams at multiple zoom levels |
| **Domain Models** | [architecture/models/](./architecture/models/) | Entity and workflow documentation |
| **Specifications** | [openspec/specs/](./openspec/specs/) | Detailed behavior specifications |
| **User Stories** | [docs/user-stories/](./docs/user-stories/) | Feature backlog |
| **AI Guidelines** | [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) | Guidelines for AI agents |

## ✨ Why This Matters

Traditional architecture documentation fails because:

- **Decision Context Lost** — "Why did we choose this?" lives in Slack threads or someone's memory
- **Diagrams Out of Sync** — Visio/Confluence diagrams diverge from the actual implementation
- **Multiple Tools** — Architecture scattered across wikis, diagrams tools, and slide decks
- **Not Reviewable** — Can't diff architecture changes or review them in pull requests
- **AI Can't Help** — Proprietary formats lock out AI assistance

### This Approach Solves It

✅ **Plain Text in Git** — All architecture artifacts version-controlled with code  
✅ **Three-View Structure** — Decisions (ADRs), structure (C4), and models (domain/flows)  
✅ **AI-Readable** — Plain text enables AI agents to understand, validate, and improve architecture  
✅ **Reviewable** — Discuss architecture changes in pull requests alongside implementation  
✅ **Discoverable** — Searchable with grep, IDE search, or AI agents  
✅ **Scalable** — Modular structure grows with your system

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — The "Why"

**[→ architecture/adr/](./architecture/adr/)**

ADRs capture the context, alternatives, and rationale behind architectural decisions. Six months from now, when someone
asks "Why did we choose UUIDs instead of auto-increment IDs?", the answer is in an ADR—not lost in Slack.

**Example:** [ADR-0001: Use UUID Primary Keys](./architecture/adr/0001-use-uuid-primary-keys.md)

Each ADR includes:

- The decision and its status
- Context and problem statement
- Options considered with trade-offs
- Decision outcome and rationale
- Consequences (positive and negative)

**Format:** We use [MADR (Markdown ADR)](https://adr.github.io/madr/) for consistency and AI-readability.

---

### 2. C4 Views — The "What"

**[→ architecture/c4-views/](./architecture/c4-views/)**

C4 diagrams show the system structure at multiple zoom levels, like a map you can zoom in and out of:

- **Level 1: System Context** — The system, its users, and external dependencies (10,000-foot view)
- **Level 2: Container** — Major services, databases, and how they communicate (1,000-foot view)
- **Level 3: Component** — Internal structure of a specific service (100-foot view)
- **Level 4: Code** — Class-level detail (rarely needed; use domain models instead)

**Example Views:**

- [System Context](./architecture/c4-views/system-context.md) — E-commerce platform overview
- [Container View](./architecture/c4-views/container.md) — Microservices and databases
- [Order Service Components](./architecture/c4-views/order-service-component.md) — Internal service structure

**Format:** We use [Structurizr DSL](https://structurizr.com/) for C4 diagrams because it's plain text, has C4-native
semantics, and generates professional-looking SVGs.

---

### 3. Domain Models & Flows — The "How"

**[→ architecture/models/](./architecture/models/)**

Domain models explain entity relationships and how business processes are executed across the system:

**Domain Entities** (with Mermaid diagrams):

- [Customer](./architecture/models/domain/customer.md)
- [Order](./architecture/models/domain/order.md)
- [Product](./architecture/models/domain/product.md)
- [Payment](./architecture/models/domain/payment.md)

**Business Flows** (sequence diagrams):

- [Create Order Flow](./architecture/models/flows/create-order.md)
- [Payment Processing](./architecture/models/flows/payment-processing.md)
- [Inventory Management](./architecture/models/flows/inventory-management.md)

**Format:** We use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for domain models and sequence diagrams because it embeds directly
in Markdown and renders everywhere (GitHub, IDEs, documentation sites).

---

## 📚 Documentation Structure

The architecture documentation is organized for easy navigation:

- **[Architecture Hub](architecture/README.md)** — Start here for the complete architecture overview
- **[Requirements](docs/requirements.md)** — System requirements (functional and non-functional)
- **[User Stories](docs/user-stories/README.md)** — Feature backlog with acceptance criteria

### 🎯 Quick Start Paths

**New to the project?**

1. Read the [System Context](./architecture/c4-views/system-context.md) for the big picture
2. Explore the [Container View](./architecture/c4-views/container.md) to see microservices
3. Review [ADR-0002: Microservices Architecture](./architecture/adr/0002-microservices-architecture.md) to understand
   why

**Want to understand a specific feature?**

1. Check the [Create Order Flow](./architecture/models/flows/create-order.md) sequence diagram
2. Review the [Order](./architecture/models/domain/order.md) domain model
3. See the implementation rationale in related ADRs

**Looking to understand past decisions?**

- Browse all ADRs in the [ADR index](./architecture/adr/README.md)

## 🚀 How This Works in Practice

### 1. Decisions Drive Structure

When you make an architectural decision, document it as an ADR:

```markdown
# ADR-0003: Event-Driven Communication

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Architecture Team

## Context and Problem Statement

How should microservices communicate asynchronously?

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: RabbitMQ message broker with event-driven patterns

### Consequences

✅ Loose coupling between services
✅ Better scalability and resilience
❌ Increased operational complexity
```

### 2. Structure Follows Decisions

The C4 views show *how* those decisions manifest in the system:

```dsl
container messageBroker "Message Broker" "RabbitMQ" {
    tags "Infrastructure"
}

orderService -> messageBroker "Publishes OrderCreated"
messageBroker -> inventoryService "Delivers OrderCreated"
```

### 3. Models Show Implementation

Domain models and flows show the concrete entities and workflows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    OrderService ->> MessageBroker: Publish OrderCreated
    MessageBroker ->> InventoryService: Deliver OrderCreated
    InventoryService ->> Database: Update stock
```

### 4. Everything Evolves Together

Update architecture in the same pull request as code:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-notification-service

# 1. Update architecture first
edit architecture/c4-views/structurizr-dsl/container.dsl
edit architecture/models/flows/order-notifications.md

# 2. Implement the feature
edit src/services/NotificationService.ts

# 3. Commit together
git add architecture/ src/
git commit -m "feat: add notification service for order updates"
```

This keeps architecture and implementation synchronized—they're reviewed together in the same PR.

## 🔄 Beyond Architecture: OpenSpec Integration

This repository also demonstrates **OpenSpec**—a complementary approach for managing detailed specifications and change
proposals with AI agents.

### Architecture vs. Specifications

| Component                        | Purpose                                                | Examples                                        |
|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture** (this approach) | System structure, decisions, and design                | ADRs, C4 diagrams, domain models                |
| **OpenSpec** (complementary)     | Detailed behavior specifications and change management | API contracts, business rules, validation logic |

### The Complete Loop

```mermaid

    C4 -->|Shows how| OpenSpec["OpenSpec<br/>(Specification)"]
    OpenSpec -->|Defines what| Code["Code<br/>(Implementation)"]
    Code -->|Implements| Tests["Tests<br/>(Verification)"]

    style OpenSpec fill:#e8f5e9,color:#000
    style Code fill:#fff3e0,color:#000
    style Tests fill:#fce4ec,color:#000
```

**Example Flow:**

1. **Decision:** [ADR-0003: Event-Driven Communication](./architecture/adr/0003-event-driven-communication.md)
2. **Structure:** [Container View](./architecture/c4-views/container.md) shows the message broker
3. **Specification:** OpenSpec change proposal defines event schemas and contracts
4. **Implementation:** Code follows the specification
5. **Validation:** Tests verify code matches specification

### OpenSpec in This Repository

- **[Specifications](./openspec/specs/)** — Current system behavior (source of truth)
- **[Change Proposals](./openspec/changes/)** — Proposed changes with tasks and spec deltas
- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** — Guidelines for AI agents working with specs and code

For details on OpenSpec workflow, see the [OpenSpec section](#-openspec-workflow) below.

## 🤖 OpenSpec Workflow

### AI Terminology

This example uses two AI categories:

| Term           | Description                                                                    | Examples                                 | Use For                                                     |
|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strong AI**  | Premium, frontier-class models with advanced reasoning and high-level strategy | Claude 4.5 Opus, Gemini Ultra            | Spec creation, architectural planning, requirement analysis |
| **Regular AI** | High-performance coding assistants, cost-effective for implementation          | Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro | Code implementation, task execution, archiving              |

When we say "AI agent", we mean an **agentic AI** that can execute multi-step tasks, read/write files, and run commands
autonomously.

### AI Agent Usage Pattern

**Planning Mode (Strong AI):**

```
"Create a new change proposal for: Add customer loyalty points system"

"Review this change proposal and ask questions about edge cases"

"Archive the loyalty-points change and update the specs"
```

**Execution Mode (Regular AI):**

```typescript
// Reference: /openspec/changes/loyalty-points/specs/customer/spec.md
// Follow guidelines in AGENTS.md
// Implement LoyaltyPoints entity following business rules

class LoyaltyPoints {
    // AI generates code that follows the specification and AGENTS.md guidelines...
}
```

**💡 Tip:** Reference architecture ADRs and C4 views alongside OpenSpec specifications for complete context. AI works
best when it understands both structure (from architecture) and behavior (from specs).

### Workflow Steps

1. **Foundation:** Document existing architecture (ADRs + C4 views) and behavior (OpenSpec specs)
2. **Decision:** Create an ADR when making a significant architectural choice
3. **Change Proposal:** Create an OpenSpec change proposal for detailed implementation
4. **Review:** Use strong AI to refine proposals and validate against architecture
5. **Execute:** Use regular AI to implement tasks following specs and ADRs
6. **Archive:** Complete the change and merge spec deltas back to source of truth
7. **Iterate:** Repeat for the next feature or improvement

## 📖 Real Examples from This Repository

### ADR Example

From [architecture/adr/0001-use-uuid-primary-keys.md](./architecture/adr/0001-use-uuid-primary-keys.md):

```markdown
# Use UUIDs for Primary Keys

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2026-01-12
* Deciders: Architecture Team

## Context and Problem Statement

Our system is distributed with requirements for horizontal scaling,
multi-region deployment, database sharding, and safe data migration.

How can we generate primary keys that support these constraints?

## Decision Outcome

Chosen: UUIDs (v4)

Rationale: UUIDs let services generate identifiers locally without
coordination, eliminate collision risk when merging data, and have
broad ecosystem support.

### Consequences

✅ Services generate IDs locally with no coordination
✅ Safe merging/importing of data between environments
❌ Larger storage and index size vs integers
❌ Less human-friendly in logs (mitigation: short aliases)
```

**See the full ADR for:** Decision drivers, all options considered, implementation examples, and review schedule.

The Container view shows microservices, databases, and communication patterns:

![Container View](./architecture/c4-views/images/container.svg)

**Key elements:**

- Web Application (React + TypeScript)
- API Gateway (Kong/NGINX)
- Microservices (Customer, Order, Product, Payment)
- Message Broker (RabbitMQ) for event-driven communication
- PostgreSQL databases per service

**See the full view for:** Service responsibilities, API flows, and event publishing patterns.

## 📝 Making Changes

### Updating Architecture Documentation

When making architectural changes, follow this pattern:

**1. Document the Decision (if significant):**

```bash
# Create a new ADR for architectural decisions (copy existing ADR as template)
cp architecture/adr/0001-use-uuid-primary-keys.md architecture/adr/0004-new-decision.md
# Edit and update with your decision details
edit architecture/adr/0004-new-decision.md
```

**2. Update Structure Views:**

```bash
# Update C4 views to reflect the change
edit architecture/c4-views/structurizr-dsl/container.dsl
# Regenerate diagrams (or use automation)
structurizr-cli export -workspace container.dsl -format svg
```

**3. Update Domain Models:**

```bash
# Update affected entity or flow diagrams
edit architecture/models/domain/order.md
edit architecture/models/flows/create-order.md
```

**4. Implement the Change:**

```bash
# Make code changes
edit src/services/OrderService.ts
```

**5. Commit Everything Together:**

```bash
git add architecture/ src/
git commit -m "feat: add order cancellation workflow

- ADR-0004: Document decision to support cancellations
- Update container view with new CancellationService
- Add cancellation flow sequence diagram
- Implement OrderService.cancelOrder() method"
```

This keeps architecture and implementation synchronized and reviewable together.

## 🌟 Philosophy: Executable Architecture

This repository demonstrates a fundamental shift: **architecture as executable code**, not static documentation.

### Core Principles

**Plain Text Everything**

- All architecture artifacts are plain text (Markdown, DSL)
- Version-controlled with Git
- Searchable, diffable, reviewable
- AI-readable and processable

**Three-Pillar Structure**

- **ADRs** preserve decision context and rationale (*why*)
- **C4 Views** show structure at multiple zoom levels (*what*)
- **Domain Models** explain entities and workflows (*how*)

**Architecture + Code Together**

- Architecture changes committed with implementation
- Both reviewed in the same pull request
- No drift between design and reality
- Single source of truth in the repository

**AI-Native Approach**

- Plain text enables AI to understand architecture
- AI can validate code against architectural intent
- AI helps maintain synchronization
- AI suggests improvements based on patterns

**Progressive Disclosure**

- Navigate to what you need (hyperlinked documentation)
- Multiple zoom levels (system → container → component)
- Modular structure scales to large systems
- Each concept in its own file

### Why "Executable"?

Architecture is executable when:

1. **Decisions are actionable** — ADRs link to specs and implementation
2. **Structure is verifiable** — C4 views can be validated against actual system topology
3. **Models drive code** — Domain models inform entity design and database schemas
4. **Validation closes the loop** — Tests confirm code matches architectural intent

**Result:** Architecture guides implementation and evolves with the system, rather than rotting in a wiki.
